# SURVEY_LEADS.md — external Lean/proof leads to mine & re-check

A dated registry of external artifacts (repos, Mathlib PRs, generated-proof corpora,
Zulip threads, papers) that may supply proofs for the DRSB foundational chains
([`FOUNDATIONS.md`](FOUNDATIONS.md)). Kept so we can **follow up and re-check for updates
later** — many of these are moving targets (open PRs, active repos).

**Last swept: 2026-07-10** (targeted re-survey for the **projective-metric frontier** —
Hilbert projective metric / Birkhoff–Hopf contraction / Perron–Frobenius / Sinkhorn convergence;
see [§ Projective-metric frontier](#projective-metric-frontier-birkhoffhopf--hilbert-metric--pf--sinkhorn-re-survey-2026-07-10).
Prior: 2026-07-04 (three continuum energy-identity gaps —
see [§ Continuum energy-identity: the three named gaps](#continuum-energy-identity-the-three-named-gaps-re-survey-2026-07-04) — plus `rjwalters/lean-genius`); full
sweep 2026-07-03. Provenance uneven; corpus-mining frontier still open, below).

> ## ⚖️ Vendoring & attribution policy (READ before pulling in ANY external proof)
> Nothing here is vendored yet. When we DO adapt/copy an external proof, provenance is

>    Record the license in the vendored file and in this registry row.
> 2. **Credit the original author** in the file header — name/handle, repo URL, and the
>    **source commit hash** (a permalink), plus "adapted by …" if we modified it. Mirror
>    the DKPS `ForMathlib` header convention ("Formalized by … ; golfed by …").
> 3. **Keep upstream license/notices** (e.g. bundle their `LICENSE`, keep copyright

> 5. Prefer **re-deriving from the statement** over copying when the license is unclear —
>    an independently authored proof of the same theorem sidesteps the licensing question

So it does NOT drop-in-close any current DRSB placeholder (our 6 SDE are Chain-4; our 6 worst-case are continuous-measure OT), BUT it is the raw material for the "reduce worst-case-structure to finite/discrete OT" strategy — most relevant to the **data-driven/empirical** worst-case theorems (`MohajerinEsfahaniKuhn2018.*`, `GaoKleywegt2023` Cor 2), whose nominal IS a finite measure.

## Projective-metric frontier: Birkhoff–Hopf / Hilbert metric / PF / Sinkhorn (re-survey 2026-07-10)

Targeted sweep for what the **current** frontier actually needs (`ForMathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/BirkhoffHopf*`,
`ChenGeorgiouPavon2021/SocOt/Sinkhorn/Convergence/Compactness/FranklinLorenz.lean`). The earlier sweeps
predate this rabbit hole, so nothing here was previously checked through this lens.

**Headline: for the two theorems we actually need, there is NOTHING to vendor or depend on.**
They must be authored in-house — which is what `ForMathlib/…/BirkhoffHopf.lean` is already doing.

| Target | Mathlib (pin `e3b73828`, 2026-07-09) | Anywhere else in Lean | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hilbert projective metric** | ❌ absent | ❌ **nothing exists, in any repo** | author in-house |
| **Birkhoff–Hopf contraction** (`tanh(Δ/4)`) | ❌ absent | ❌ **nothing exists, in any repo** | author in-house |
| Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue theory | ❌ absent (PRs open, unmerged) | ✅ two sorry-free Lean 4 repos | available — **but likely off our critical path** |
| Sinkhorn / matrix scaling convergence | ❌ absent | 🟡 partial, *wrong proof route* | in-house |

### ⚠️ Name-collision traps (every `Birkhoff`/`Hilbert` hit in Mathlib is a DIFFERENT theorem)
Do not let a grep hit fool you — **none** of these is our target:
- `Analysis/Convex/Birkhoff.lean` → Birkhoff–**von Neumann** (doubly-stochastic = convex hull of permutations)
- `Order/Birkhoff.lean` → Birkhoff **representation** (finite distributive lattices)
- `Dynamics/BirkhoffSum/*` → **ergodic** Birkhoff sums/averages
- `Analysis/InnerProductSpace/*`, `l2Space` → **Hilbert space**; `…/Projection.lean` → Hilbert **projection** theorem
- `Analysis/Oscillation.lean` → modulus of continuity, *not* Hilbert-metric oscillation
- `Analysis/Convex/Gauge.lean` → **Minkowski** gauge, unrelated
- "Perron" → Paolo **Perrone** (category theory) and the **Perron integral**; "Frobenius" → Frobenius **norm** / **endomorphism**; "Wielandt" → group-theory Jordan–Wielandt

### What Mathlib *does* have (pin-verified)
- `Matrix.IsIrreducible` / `Matrix.IsPrimitive` + quiver interface — `LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Irreducible/Defs.lean` (PR **#28728**, merged 2025-10-30). **Definitions only**: grep for `spectralRadius`/`Perron`/`eigenvalue` in that dir is empty.
- Generic `ConvexCone` API (`Analysis/Convex/Cone/*`) and order cones. The cone *substrate* exists; no comparability relation, no Hilbert metric, no projective diameter is built on it.

### Mathlib PF PR cluster — still ALL OPEN as of 2026-07-10 🔁
Re-checked; **none merged**, so a pin bump does not help. Do not plan around these landing.

| PR | Content | State |
|---|---|---|

| #39920 | PF for primitive matrices | OPEN, labeled `blocked-by-other-PR` (on #39919) |

Docs-site `PerronFrobenius/Primitive.html` **404s** — independent confirmation it is not on master.

### External PF sources (sorry-free, permissive) — ready if PF is ever needed
> ⚠️ Per `AGENTS.md`, our finite Sinkhorn existence (`ForMathlib.matrix_scaling_exists`) was proved
> **without** Perron–Frobenius (log-domain convex minimization). PF may not be on the critical path at all.

Self-contained Apache fallback. |

### `gpeyre/flow-sinkhorn` — re-examined, does NOT help here
MIT, Lean 4, commit `ff053cc1`; 28 open goals all confined to `Comparator/Challenge.lean` (the AI-proof-harness *spec*), `Comparator/Solution.lean` proved.
**Grep for `hilbert|birkhoff|tanh|projective|matrix.scaling|doubly.stochastic` = 0 hits.** Its Sinkhorn convergence goes via **KL-descent + Pinsker**, not the Hilbert metric, and it never states Franklin–Lorenz (1989). Reusable for finite entropic-OT *rates*; supplies **none** of our contraction machinery.

### Honest method caveat
No `gh` CLI / GitHub token in the survey environment, so authenticated **code**-search (`/search/code`) could not be run (401); grep.app/Sourcegraph were rate-limited. The negatives rest on web search + GitHub *repo* search + pinned-Mathlib grep + direct clone inspection, which corroborate each other. **A keyed code-search is the one stone left unturned** — worth one re-check before anyone concludes "definitely nowhere".

Results are **"now migrating to Mathlib"** — so **gap #1 (Kolmogorov extension → continuum reference measure) is a *vendor / wait-for-upstream*, NOT a from-scratch port.** Itô "in progress" (building toward Itô's lemma); still **NO Girsanov, no KL** (gap #2 remains open). **Re-check before Phase-2 continuum work.** (We upgraded our pin to latest master `d3716e6d` on 2026-07-04 — the extension is **still not landed** there; keep watching.) |

## The strong-duality capstone: `hge` (survey 2026-07-10, **corrected**)

The last edge on all four strong-duality capstones is **`hge : dualValue ≤ primalValue`** — the
duality gap is zero. It replaced `hattain` ("some feasible `μ` attains the dual value"), which
bundled the gap with attainment; the proofs only used the gap. `hbddP` is gone too.

⚠ **Correction to an earlier entry in this file.** `hge` is *not* reachable by tightness +
Prokhorov. That route yields *attainment of the supremum*, which `hge` no longer needs. `hge` is
Blanchet–Murthy Thm 1 / Gao–Kleywegt Thm 1, and its proof selects near-maximizers `x(y)` of the
`c`-transform `sup_x (f x − λ* c(x,y))` and pushes the nominal forward — i.e. it needs
**Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection**, `ABSENT` from Mathlib (FOUNDATIONS Chain 1).

| Gap | Needed for | Lean status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~measurable selection (KRN)~~ | `hge` ingredient (1) | ✅ **SIDESTEPPED, 2026-07-10.** KRN is not needed: for a *continuous* integrand on a *separable* domain the supremum is achieved to within `ε` on a countable dense set, and `Nat.find` on an enumeration gives a measurable ε-argmax. `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.exists_measurable_eps_argmax{,_of_separable}` + `ForMathlib.OT.exists_coupling_lagrangian_ge` (the converse Lagrangian bound). Axiom-clean. | Villani Thm 5.10 (`c`-transform); Blanchet–Murthy 2019 Thm 1 |
| ~~optimal multiplier / complementary slackness~~ | `hge` ingredient (2) | ✅ **PROVED 2026-07-10** — `ForMathlib.Analysis.exists_nonneg_multiplier`. Mathlib has `ConcaveOn` + slope lemmas but **no sub/supergradient existence anywhere** (grep-verified); `ForMathlib/Analysis/Supergradient.lean` supplies the 1-D case and is upstreamable as-is. | Blanchet–Murthy 2019 Thm 1; Gao–Kleywegt 2023 Thm 1 / Prop 2 |
| **concavity of the DRO value function** | `hge` ingredient (3) — **the only thing still missing** | **ABSENT (ours to write).** `h t = sup{𝔼_μ[f] : ∃π, 𝔼_π[c] ≤ t}` is concave because `a·π₁+(1−a)·π₂` couples `a·μ₁+(1−a)·μ₂` with `ν`, and cost/reward are affine in the coupling. Plus Slater (`0<δ`) for finiteness near `δ`, and continuity of a concave function on the interior. Measure-theoretic bookkeeping, not new analysis. | — |
| **(A) lsc of the transport cost / `otCost`** | attainment (worst-case-measure existence), *not* `hge` | **ABSENT** | Villani, *OT Old and New*, Thm 4.1; Santambrogio §1.2 |
| **convexity of `klDiv` in its first argument** | the *entropic* value function's concavity (Sinkhorn `hge` ingredient 3) | ✅ **PROVED 2026-07-10** — `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.toReal_klDiv_mix_le`. Mathlib has `klDiv` + `toReal_klDiv_smul_left/right` but **no convexity** (grep-verified). Two-line corollary of the DV *dual* formula: `KL(·‖ν)` is a sup of affine functionals. Upstreamable. | Dupuis–Ellis; Csiszár |
| **(B) lsc of `klDiv`** | attainment on the entropic ball | 🟡 **setwise version PROVED 2026-07-10** (`ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.toReal_klDiv_le_of_tendsto_integral`); weak version needs bounded *continuous* test functions (Lusin upgrade) | Dupuis–Ellis Lemma 1.4.3 |
| **(C) Donsker–Varadhan *dual* variational formula** | the route to (B) | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-10** — `toReal_klDiv_eq_sSup_dvDualSet`, axiom-clean. Not the Gibbs formula (`isGreatest_donskerVaradhan`, sup over *measures*, attained); this sups over *functions* and is not attained. | Dupuis–Ellis Prop 1.4.2 |

⚠ The trap in (C), and what its proof is built around: Lean's `llr μ ν x = log (dμ/dν x)` with
`Real.log 0 = 0`, so `exp (llr μ ν) = 1` — *not* `0` — on `{dμ/dν = 0}`. `truncLLR` puts `-n`, not
`0`, on that (μ-null) set; the partition functions then converge to exactly `1`.

## Continuum energy-identity: the three named gaps (re-survey 2026-07-04)

Proving the DRSB continuum energy identity `D(P^{u,ρ₀}‖R) = D(ρ₀‖ρ₀^W) + 𝔼[∫₀¹ ½‖u‖²]` (CGP 4.19)
past its Euler–Maruyama instance is now walled by **three sharply-named, disjoint missing Mathlib
pieces** (everything around them — discrete Cameron–Martin, KL DPI, the projection-exhaustion
martingale theorem `ForMathlib.klDiv_map_tendsto`, and the Riemann-quadrature limit
`ForMathlib.tendsto_emEnergy_sampled` — is proved & dependency-clean). Were these anticipated at survey
time? Two of three; here is the mapping so we don't re-derive the wall each session:

| Gap | Needed for | Anticipated 2026-07-03? | Status after re-survey | Lead / action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **(1) Kolmogorov extension** ✅ **VENDORED + DONE 2026-07-04** — `ForMathlib/KolmogorovExtension/` (3 files, Apache-2.0, attributed, dependency-clean) + `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.wienerMeasure` (the continuum reference `R` on `ℝ≥0→ℝ`, `IsProbabilityMeasure`, projective-limit property). Gap closed in-project. | the continuum reference path measure on `ℝ→X` | Partially (on radar via `brownian-motion`, but not called out as the reference-measure blocker) | **SOLVED in a standalone Apache-2.0 package** — `RemyDegenne/kolmogorov_extension4` provides `projectiveLimit` + `isProjectiveLimit_projectiveLimit` for Polish/standard-Borel index spaces (source-verified 2026-07-04). It is **~2 local files** (`KolmogorovExtension.lean` + `RegularContent.lean`) building on Mathlib's own `MeasureTheory.Constructions.ProjectiveFamilyContent` (already in our pin). `brownian-motion`'s `Gaussian/ProjectiveLimit.lean` shows the assembly: `gaussianLimit := projectiveLimit gaussianProjectiveFamily _`. | **VENDOR `kolmogorov_extension4` (2 files, fix v4.31→v4.32 API drift) + apply `projectiveLimit` to Mathlib's `BrownianReal.projectiveFamily` (already in-pin, proven consistent) ⇒ the continuum reference `R` in a few lines.** NOT multi-session. (Can't just `require` it: it pins Lean v4.31.0, we're on v4.32.0-rc1 → Mathlib-rev conflict; vendor instead.) |
| **(2) Itô / Girsanov stack** | the feedback-drift path-measure density `dP^u/dR` (a stochastic exponential) | **Yes** — audited `formal-mathfin` (1-D/finance Girsanov, no KL) + `brownian-motion` (Itô in progress) | Still open (both sources 1-D and/or KL-free) | Port `formal-mathfin` Itô/SDE → multi-D + add KL; the genuine multi-session project. |
| **(3) Infinite-product absolute continuity (Kakutani dichotomy)** | any *concrete* infinite-dimensional instance (`∏ N(cₙ,1) ≪ ∏ N(0,1)` iff `∑cₙ²<∞`) | **No** — new; only surfaced when we tried the `infinitePiNat` concrete route this session | Open; **no known Lean source** (pin has only Riesz–Markov–Kakutani, unrelated) | Add to query terms; author ourselves or find a Hellinger-integral / Kakutani-dichotomy lead. |

**"We can always upgrade the Mathlib pin" — does it close any gap? (UPGRADED 2026-07-04).**
Done — bumped the pin `476fb97b62` (2026-06-11) → latest master `d3716e6d` (Lean `v4.31.0-rc2` →
`v4.32.0-rc1`); clean build (8662 jobs), all headline theorems still dependency-clean. **The upgrade
closes none of the three gaps yet** (re-checked against the new pin):
- **Gap #1** — master's `Probability/BrownianMotion/GaussianProjectiveFamily.lean` *still* says Kolmogorov
  extension "is not in Mathlib yet"; `MeasureTheory/Constructions/` has only the `IsProjectiveLimit`
  predicate (`Projective.lean`) + the premeasure content (`ProjectiveFamilyContent.lean`) + **the newly
  present `ClosedCompactCylinders.lean`** — the *tightness/compactness ingredient* for the extension. So
  it is **actively being assembled upstream but not landed.** Action: **watch master and bump the pin the
  moment the extension theorem lands** (cheapest path); if we need it sooner, vendor from
  `RemyDegenne/brownian-motion` (Apache-2.0, already has it). This is the gap most likely to close by
  upgrade in the near term.
- **Gap #2 (Itô/Girsanov)** — `Mathlib/Probability` on master has **no** Girsanov / stochastic-integral /
  Itô file. Upgrade won't help; still the multi-session port.
- **Gap #3 (Kakutani)** — not on master (no Hellinger / infinite-product-ac declaration). Upgrade won't help.

So the standing posture: **re-check master + upgrade opportunistically at Phase-2 start (gap #1 first),
and vendor from `brownian-motion` only if upstream lags.** Bumping the pin also risks breaking our proved
`ForMathlib` layer, so do it deliberately (rebuild + Lean dependency audit re-verify), not reflexively.

### `rjwalters/lean-genius` — surveyed 2026-07-04 (NEGATIVE for our chains; collaboration lead)
| Lead | Link | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `rjwalters/lean-genius` 🔁 ✅SURVEYED 2026-07-04 | https://github.com/rjwalters/lean-genius | **Research *platform* (open-problem attack surface: Erdős, irrationality, fixed-point, Yang–Mills), not a probability library.** 5,679 `.lean` files. **License: mostly per-file Apache-2.0** (headers "Copyright (c) 2026 Lean Genius / RJ Walters … Released under Apache 2.0"; some ported-from-DeepMind-AlphaProof with their own attribution) — **but NO top-level `LICENSE` file** (several headers say "as described in the file LICENSE", which is absent → flag when collaborating). **NEGATIVE for all three gaps and for every theorem we've proved:** grep-empty on `girsanov`, `ito`, `klDiv`, `condExp`/`martingale`, `gaussian`, `riemann`, `DPI`; `kakutani`→ 152× the *fixed-point* theorem, `kolmogorov`→ SLLN/complexity, `cameron`→ Cameron–*Erdős*, `brownian`→ a local first-passage `BrownianMotion` struct in `BallotProblemOQ02OQ02OQ05.lean` (hitting-time measurability, Karatzas–Shreve). **Only genuine neighbour:** `Proofs/AntitoneIntegralSumComparison.lean` (`integral_sandwich`) — the monotone integral-test sandwich, itself a thin wrapper of Mathlib `AntitoneOn.sum_le_integral`/`integral_le_sum`; cross-referenced from our `ForMathlib…tendsto_equispaced_riemannSum` docstring as related work. **Collaboration:** maintainer **RJ Walters** (`rjwalters`) is a desirable future collaborator on navigable AI-proof webs — no reuse yet, but keep on the radar and attribute if we ever do. |

## Declaration search engines (find hidden supporting lemmas — semantic, not name-match)

| Tool | Link | Use |
|---|---|---|
| LeanExplore | https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11085 | indexes declarations across many Lean packages; downloadable DB/API |
| LeanSearch v2 | https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.13137 · repo `frenzymath/LeanSearch-v2` (`benchmark/MathlibQR.json`) | global-premise retrieval + benchmark; query for premise groups (stochastic matrices, convexity, KL, Sion, Birkhoff) |
| Moogle / LeanSearch / `loogle` | (web) | quick premise/lemma lookup by type/name |

Use these for the *supporting* lemmas (convexity, stochastic matrices, KL, finite sums,
eigenvalues) rather than the top-level theorems.

## Generated-proof corpora — QUERY THESE (ordinary GitHub search misses them)

The search-strategy shift: mine large generated/searched-proof datasets for the query
terms below, rather than more theorem-name GitHub searches.

## Mathlib PR search recipes (what actually worked)

- **`label:LLM-generated` × AREA, not theorem name.** Exact theorem-term searches were
  mostly empty; area clusters productive: `label:LLM-generated LinearAlgebra Matrix`
  (→ `Matrix/Nondegenerate`, …), `label:LLM-generated Analysis Convex Gauge`,
  `label:LLM-generated Analysis` (→ RKHS/spectral).
- **Prover-name searches** beyond the label: `Seed Prover`, `lean-eval`, `Aristotle`,
  `Harmonic` (e.g. a symplectic-determinant PR credited to Seed Prover / lean-eval).
- **"Agent golf" index PRs** map LLM-touched areas (not theorem sources): #37968,
  #38104 (MeasureTheory), #38144 (NumberTheory); query "Extracted from #37968".
- **Zulip `AI-authored-projects`** channel — closed/generated-PR discovery surface
  (also the `AI-assisted MDS and spectral PRs` topic).

## Exhaustion status & the next frontier (as of 2026-07-03)

**Manual discovery (web / GitHub / Zulip / registry) is ~saturated** — diminishing returns
after several passes. **The remaining frontier is bulk corpus mining**: scripted exact +
fuzzy search over the generated-proof datasets and declaration indices (above). Only if a
corpus pass over the query terms below also comes up empty is the search *genuinely*
exhausted.

| Surface | Exhausted? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub exact theorem search | yes | diminishing returns |
| Mathlib PR/issue (label/closed) | mostly | maybe one more label pass, low yield |
| Zulip archive | **no** | READ the exact DV & PF threads, don't just locate them |
| Reservoir / package registry | mostly | low yield |
| **Generated-proof corpora** | **no** | the remaining frontier — bulk-query it |
| Chain 3 sources | no | Mathlib doubly-stochastic base + `flow-sinkhorn` still to inspect |
| Chain 2 sources | mostly | `gibbs-variational` AUDITED (Gaussian-KL lemmas reusable); `flow-sinkhorn` AUDITED (finite KL/Pinsker); DV Zulip + `YuanheZ/lean-stat-learning-theory` (ICML2026 SLT, 91⭐) still to skim |
| Chain 4 sources | AUDITED, **claim corrected 2026-07-10** | `formal-mathfin` (⭐ Apache-2.0): has a real Itô development, but **NOT Girsanov** — `Foundations/Girsanov.lean` is the single Black–Scholes statement `bs_discounted_isQMartingale`, and `GaussianGirsanov.lean` is a finite-dimensional Esscher tilt. `brownian-motion` (Apache-2.0): Brownian existence is sorry-free, but its stochastic integral covers only **simple processes** (`DoobMeyer.lean` carries 25 open goals). **Girsanov and the stochastic exponential (Doléans-Dade) are ABSENT from every Lean source surveyed.** Nothing drop-in; nothing shortcuts the port. |
| Chain 1-heavy OT | mostly (manually) | likely absent bar finite/scaffold fragments |
| Chain 4 | enough for now | defer |

**Next concrete move:** download/index `Lean-GitHub`, `Lean-Workbook` searched proofs,
`OProofs` (if accessible), `LeanNavigator`, `LeanSearch-v2` data, `LeanExplore` DB,
`CAM-Bench`, `AMBER` (also `Pythagoras-Prover`/ALF, arXiv 2606.12594); then exact+fuzzy
grep the query-terms block above (Sinkhorn, matrix scaling, doubly stochastic, Birkhoff,
Perron, Collatz, KL, Pinsker, Donsker, Varadhan, Fenchel, Legendre, convex conjugate,
Sion, Kantorovich, Wasserstein, coupling, cTransform, Ito, Girsanov, FeynmanKac).

## Re-check cadence
The 🔁 items (flow-sinkhorn, the PF PR cluster, brownian-motion, formal-mathfin) are
active — re-sweep before starting the corresponding chain, and again at PR-prep time
(Mathlib master moves; a gap may have closed). Update **Last swept** above when you do.
