## Snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| Toolchain | `leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0-rc1` |
| Mathlib | `e3b73828…` (2026-07-09), `inputRev = master` — **policy: track latest master** |
| Open goals | **0** — the repo is `sorry`-free |
| DRSB card claims | ✅ **proved** (`wdrsb_cost_bound`, `sdrsb_cost_bound`) |
| Strong duality (all four) | ✅ **proved**, each `le_antisymm(weak, one explicit attainment edge)` |
| `energy_identity` | ✅ **closed** — Girsanov content isolated to the explicit `hCM` edge |
| Birkhoff–Hopf contraction | ✅ **proved twice**, by two independent routes |
| Sinkhorn convergence | ✅ **proved** — no placeholder anywhere on the critical path |

Everything is `lake build` green and axiom-clean (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` only —
no `sorryAx`). ⚠️ `lake env lean <file>` typechecks source but `#print axioms` resolves against the
*compiled* `.olean`s: run `lake build` before trusting an axiom audit.

## CURRENT FRONTIER (2026-07-10) — there isn't one

The projective-metric frontier is closed. The finite Birkhoff–Hopf contraction theorem, which the
2026-07-10 survey found **exists nowhere in Lean** (`SURVEY_LEADS.md` § Projective-metric frontier),
is now proved here from scratch — and proved *twice*, deliberately.

### Two independent proofs of the same seam

`ForMathlib.Matrix.positive_kernel_strict_birkhoff_contraction_coefficient` is the public seam that
`FranklinLorenz.lean` consumes. Both routes discharge it; neither uses the other (grep-verified: no
`PaperRoute` file references any Doeblin theorem). They share only the definitions and the
elementary `sSup`/positivity lemmas.

| | `BirkhoffHopf.lean` — **Doeblin route** | `PaperRoute/*` — **Eveson–Nussbaum route** |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | one direct estimate | the paper's 8-step chain, theorem-for-theorem |
| Key step | sum `hweight` over one index ⇒ pointwise `p ≤ B q` | reduce to a 2-dimensional subspace |
| Analytic core | weighted AM–GM (`Real.geom_mean_le_arith_mean2_weighted`) | MVT on `g t = log(αe^t+1) − log(e^t+α)` |
| Constant | coarse `(B−1)/B` directly | sharp `(α−1)/(α+1)`, then weakened |
| Calculus? | **none** | yes (`Convex.norm_image_sub_le_of_norm_hasDerivWithin_le`) |

**The Doeblin route is the short one and it is not in the literature we distilled.** The published
proofs treat the two-atom case as the irreducible core and reduce the `n`-coordinate problem to it —
Carroll (2004) Step 3 by linear programming, Eveson–Nussbaum by 2-dimensional subspaces. Neither
reduction is needed: normalizing `p_j ∝ a_j y_j`, `q_j ∝ b_j y_j` and **summing the pairwise weight
hypothesis over one index** collapses it to the pointwise Doeblin condition `p_j ≤ B q_j`. Two linear
facts then force `u/v ≤ (λ+R)/(1+λR)`, and one application of weighted AM–GM finishes. The
coarseness of `(B−1)/B` is exactly what makes that last step elementary — the earlier note in this
file claiming the coarse constant "does not appear to make the proof easier" was wrong.

Consequently `two_point_weighted_average_…` is now a **corollary** (instantiate the finite theorem at
`κ = Fin 2`), not a prerequisite. The arrow in the papers is reversed.

### Why keep both

The paper route earns its keep: it makes the Lean text checkable against a citation, line by line
(Prop 2.9(b), Lemma 3.11, Lemma 3.12, Lemma 5.1, Thm 5.3, Thm 6.2 each have a named theorem), and it
proves the **sharp** constant `(α−1)/(α+1)` where the Doeblin route only gets `(B−1)/B`. If anyone
ever needs the sharp Birkhoff constant `tanh(Δ/4)`, `PaperRoute/TwoByTwo.lean` already has it.

Two deliberate departures from the sources, both recorded in the docstrings:

- **Prop 2.9**: the *nonnegative-hull* statement is the general one — the argument never uses
  `∑ w = 1` — so the convex-hull statement is its corollary rather than a separate proof.
- **Lemma 5.1**: the paper's doubly-stochastic + IVT normalization is unnecessary. With
  `ρ = A₀₀A₁₁/(A₀₁A₁₀)` (and `hdet` says exactly `ρ ≠ 1`), the witnesses `α = √ρ`,
  `colScale = (√(A₀₁A₁₁/(A₀₀A₁₀)), 1)`, `rowScale = (1/A₀₁, 1/(A₁₀·colScale₀))` are explicit;
  `ρ < 1` is handled by a row swap, which sends `ρ ↦ 1/ρ`.

### ⚠️ A statement bug that was found and fixed

`hard_core_franklinLorenz_right_column_pairwise_log_correction_geometric_bound` assumed
`IsBirkhoffHopfContractionCoefficient G γ` **alone**. That is not enough: the orbit alternates
`a (k+1) = p / (G · b k)` and `b (k+1) = q / (Gᵀ · a k)`, so the contraction recursion applies each
kernel on alternate half-steps. Deriving `Gᵀ`'s coefficient from `G`'s would require `γ` to be the
*sharp* Birkhoff constant — a strictly harder theorem, so the hypothesis is now explicit and is
discharged by `positive_kernel_strict_birkhoff_contraction_coefficient_transpose`, whose explicit
coefficient is transpose-invariant.

**The general lesson:** an alternating algorithm needs its operator's coefficient *and its
transpose's*. Grep for any other seam that takes a one-sided contraction hypothesis.

### How Sinkhorn convergence closes

`FranklinLorenz.lean`'s two hard cores are proved. With `S k = Gᵀ·a k`, `T k = G·b k`, the updates
read `b (k+1) = q / S k`, `a (k+1) = p / T k`. Since `x ↦ c/x` is a projective isometry, the two
correction spreads `α k = d(a (k+1), a k)`, `β k = d(b (k+1), b k)` satisfy `β (k+1) ≤ γ·α k` and
`α (k+1) ≤ γ·β k`. So `M k = max (α k) (β k)` obeys the **single-step** recursion `M (k+1) ≤ γ·M k`,
giving `M k ≤ γ^k · M 0` with no parity argument. Hard core 4 (the left/row side) is then an
*instantiation*, not a second proof: `IsFiniteFranklinLorenzScalingOrbit` is symmetric under
`(p,q,G,a,b) ↦ (q,p,Gᵀ,b,a)` — the row and column updates swap into each other.

### Upstreaming

Nothing here exists in Mathlib. The clean PR candidates, in dependency order:
`finiteHilbertProjectiveLogSpread` + its `sSup` API → `positive_kernel_birkhoff_hopf_contraction`
(the Doeblin proof is short and self-contained) → `matrix_scaling_exists`. Already queued from
earlier passes: `toReal_klDiv_map_le` (KL data-processing) and
`exists_measurableEmbedding_nat_of_separating`.

## Landed work (history)

*Kept for provenance. The per-session narrative — including the soundness audits and what each
proof actually cost — is in [`JOURNAL.md`](JOURNAL.md).*

- **Next steps + the full triage live in [`PROOF_PIPELINE.md`](PROOF_PIPELINE.md).**
  Per the user (2026-07): **no Fable** — decompose each remaining target into its natural
  subproblems and prove step-by-step with the thinking budget turned up. The SDE/PDE and
  OT-measurable-selection blocks may still need a documented `dependency` or a Mathlib-infra lift
  (decide with the coordinator). ForMathlib upstreaming queue:
  DV ✓, Normalization ✓, WeakDuality ✓ (three kernels, incl. the Ξ-restricted one),
  SinkhornScaling ✓ (`matrix_scaling_exists`), **KLDataProcessing ✓ (`toReal_klDiv_map_le` — the
  KL data-processing inequality; a clean standalone Mathlib PR candidate)**,
  **PathEmbedding ✓ (`exists_measurableEmbedding_nat_of_separating` — standard-Borel + countable
  separating family ⇒ measurable embedding into `ℕ→ℝ` with measurable left inverse; also a Mathlib
  PR candidate)**.
- **Source-pass note (2026-07-07):** `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/GaussianCameronMartin.lean`
  stages the next sequence-model Cameron–Martin brick from `PLAN_CONTINUUM_CLOSURE.md` as a
  candidate no-placeholder overlay: iid `stdSeqGaussian`, `prefixFiltration`, finite-prefix marginals,
  shift/restriction commutation, and `cmDensityProcess`. The producing sandbox had no Lean compiler;
  run `lake env lean ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/GaussianCameronMartin.lean` before marking M2.4 done.

- **Plan A(i) DONE (2026-07-04) — the continuum embedding edge is now a THEOREM**
  (`ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/PathEmbedding.lean`, all dependency-clean; JOURNAL Session 4 addendum 8).
  `energy_eq_klReal_via_embedding`'s abstract measurable-embedding hypothesis is *constructed* for the
  continuous-path model (`C(T,ℝ)`, dense-time evaluation), via Mathlib's existing `ContinuousMap`
  Polish instances + Lusin–Souslin — **no brownian-motion vendor needed**. `eq_toReal_klDiv_continuousMap_of_tendsto`
  is the continuum identity for `C(T,ℝ)` laws with the embedding edge discharged; only `hconv`
  (gap #2 Girsanov) + the `SBData.Path := C([0,1],X)` re-typing (roadmap step 3) remain.
- When a `reference/` result is validated and promoted, update `reference/README.md`.

- **Done:** repo scaffolded; `ForMathlib` + 5 paper libraries + `Drsb` capstone all
  `lake build` green; prose transcriptions + PDFs in place; `formalization.yaml` maps
  every declaration to its source.
- **Proofs landed (proof pass, foundational-first):**
  - `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.DonskerVaradhan` — the full DV family (dependency-clean).
  - `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.Normalization.isProbabilityMeasure_inv_univ_smul` —
    normalize a finite nonzero measure to a probability measure (new; the first
    pipeline extraction — a genuine Mathlib gap, consumed by `exists_worstCase_gibbs`).
  - `WangGaoXie2023.logPartition_eq_gibbs_sSup` (DV applied to the tilted reward),
    `worstCase_conditional_tilted` (density rewrite), and
    `exists_worstCase_gibbs` (Remark 4: normalize the unnormalized Gibbs measure → a
    probability measure ∝ the tilt; now via the ForMathlib lemma).
  - `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.staticSB_eq_entropicOT` (T0: the `hgibbs` rewrite — when the
    endpoint law IS the entropic-OT reference, the two `sInf`s coincide).
  - `BlanchetMurthy2019.wdro_strong_duality_dualFn` — the `Lc`-form of
    `wdro_strong_duality`, derived from it by defeq. Not an independent strong-duality
    proof; the debt stays in one place.
  - `ForMathlib.OT.expect_le_dualIntegrand_add_lam_couplingCost` — the OT-DRO
    per-coupling **weak-duality kernel** (ported from `reference/V4.lean`, generalized to
    arbitrary cost `c`); dependency-clean.
  - ⭐ **BOTH DRSB evaluation-card claims PROVED, dependency-clean** — the project's headline
    result `𝔼_perturbed[V] ≤ 𝔼_worst-case[V]` for both balls:
    - `Drsb.wdrsb_cost_bound` (Wasserstein): weak-duality kernel + `sqCost` symmetry, under
      regularity + the OT-attainment edge `hOT`.
    - `Drsb.sdrsb_cost_bound` (Sinkhorn): composes the proved
      `WangGaoXie2023.sinkhorn_weak_duality_kernel` (per-point Gibbs/DV bound integrated
      over `p₀`) with `budget ≤ ε`, under `hκ>0` + the Sinkhorn attainment+disintegration
      edge `hSink`; dual restricted to `0<lam` (the `lam=0` `logPartition` is junk — a
      third statement issue found this pass; ess-sup convention unencoded).
    The cards need only the `≤` direction; the strong-duality `≥` seams are now discharged
    too (below), each modulo one explicit attainment hypothesis rather than a placeholder.
  - **General duality + the "strong = weak + attainment" pattern** (dependency-clean):
    `GaoKleywegt2023.weak_duality_prop1` (general Wasserstein `v_P ≤ v_D`, via the kernel +
    coupling ε-approx + the unconditional `Real.sSup_neg` for `Φ`↔sup-form) and
    `GaoKleywegt2023.strong_duality_thm1` = `le_antisymm(weak, attainment)` — the `≥` is a
    single explicit **attainment edge**, isolating the whole strong-duality gap to that one
    OT measurable-selection fact. `Drsb.wdrsb_strong_duality` delegates to it (`sqCost`
    symmetric ⇒ `Lc = −Φ`), completing the **WDRSB capstone** (cost bound + strong duality).
  - **Both weak-duality kernels are staged in `ForMathlib.OT`** (paper-agnostic,
    upstreamable): `expect_le_dualIntegrand_add_lam_couplingCost` (Wasserstein) and
    `expect_kernel_le_lam_sinkhornBudget_add_logPartition` (entropic/Sinkhorn) — the two
    "from-scratch" Mathlib gaps the cards descend from.
  - **Atop-a-placeholder reductions** (concentrate debt, not dependency-clean):
    `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.schrodingerBridge_KL_eq_SOC` (sInf-translation atop
    `energy_identity`) and `optimal_control_eq_neg_grad_value` (atop
    `optimal_control_eq_grad_log` + a `grad`-negation edge).
  - **ALL strong-duality *equalities* proved** (2026-07), each `le_antisymm(weak,
    attainment)` with the `≥` isolated to one explicit OT-attainment hypothesis:
    `BlanchetMurthy2019.wdro_strong_duality` (primary Wasserstein), `WangGaoXie2023.strong_duality`
    (Sinkhorn Theorem 1(II)), and the two **`Drsb` capstones** `wdrsb_strong_duality` /
    `sdrsb_strong_duality` — **`Drsb` is now proved** (all four card+duality results land).
  - `WangGaoXie2023.primal_feasible_radius_nonneg` (was the mis-stated `primal_feasible_iff`)
    — the honest necessity half of Theorem 1(I), `0 ≤ κ ⇒ (Nonempty → 0 ≤ ε)`, dependency-clean
    (see §6). Sufficiency is the deferred ρ̄-ball attainment edge.
- **Finite Sinkhorn scaling — ✅ PROVED, dependency-clean (2026-07):**
  `ForMathlib.matrix_scaling_exists` + `ForMathlib.sinkhorn_potentials_exist`
  (`ForMathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/SinkhornScaling.lean`). Mathlib has **neither** Brouwer
  nor the Birkhoff/Hilbert-metric contraction (grep-verified), so the proof is a **log-domain
  convex minimization** of `ψ(b)=∑ᵢ pᵢ log(∑ⱼ Gᵢⱼ bⱼ) − ∑ⱼ qⱼ log bⱼ` over the open simplex:
  boundary blow-up `−qⱼ log bⱼ→+∞` confines the sublevel set to an explicit compact set
  (extreme value theorem — no coercivity lemma), and the marginal equations fall out of the
  1-D directional derivatives along `eⱼ−eₖ` (`IsLocalMin.hasDerivAt_eq_zero`), with **mass
  conservation `∑p=∑q` exactly killing the Lagrange multiplier**. `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.
  sinkhorn_potentials_exist` now delegates to a proved proof. `matrix_scaling_exists`
  is a clean general lemma staged for Mathlib upstreaming (Sinkhorn scaling is a genuine gap).
- **Vendored external proof + discrete energy identity — ✅ landed (2026-07):** vendored
  `mrdouglasny/gibbs-variational`'s `GaussianEntropy.lean` (Apache-2.0, commit `75e08d8`) →
  `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/GaussianEntropy.lean` (Cameron–Martin `KL(N(·+h)‖N)=½‖h‖²`;
  attribution in file header + README + `formalization.yaml` + `SURVEY_LEADS.md`). Built on
  it, the **proved, dependency-clean** Euler–Maruyama discrete energy identity
  `ForMathlib…klDiv_emShift_eq_emEnergy` → `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.energy_identity_euler_maruyama`:
  `(KL(P^u‖P^0)).toReal = ∑ₖ Δt·½‖u_k‖²`, the discrete/Gaussian layer of `energy_identity`
  (4.19) — the quantity the card measures (§3). The continuous `energy_identity` stays a bare
  placeholder (count unchanged at 12); the single remaining edge is the Δt→0 SDE limit
  (PROOF_PIPELINE §2).
- **Worst-case structure — ✅ BOTH GaoKleywegt corollaries PROVED, dependency-clean (2026-07);
  `GaoKleywegt2023` is now proved:**
  - `dataDriven_worstCase_cor2ii` (Cor 2(ii), eq. 29 — the `≤ N+1`-atom empirical worst case):
    `μ*` built as the explicit `K = 2` weighted-Dirac double-sum; probability measure,
    `∈ ambiguitySet` (explicit transport plan + `ForMathlib.OT.otCost_le_couplingCost`),
    closed-form `Ψ`-expectation and the eq. (29) split-form identity all **proved**. Local
    copies of `isProbabilityMeasure_wsum`/`integral_wsum`/`map_wsum` (→ ForMathlib dedup TODO).
  - `worstCase_structure_cor1` (Cor 1(ii), eq. 27 — the general-`ν` 2-map transport
    `μ* = pstar·T̄#ν + (1−pstar)·T*#ν`): same house pattern via `Measure.map` pushforwards +
    `integral_map` (with **regularity edges** since `c`/`Ψ` carry no standing measurability);
    2nd marginal `= ν` because `snd∘(T,id)=id`; eq. (27) measure form is `rfl`.

  Both are §5-safe: the structured optimizer is **not** hypothesized — only genuinely-weaker
  ingredient edges are (mixture weight, measurable a.e.-argmin maps/atoms, feasibility budget,
  and one `≥` attainment edge — the `le_antisymm(constructive, one edge)` posture shared with
  `MohajerinEsfahaniKuhn2018.worstCase_exists`).
- **Data-driven duality equality — ✅ PROVED, dependency-clean (2026-07); `MohajerinEsfahaniKuhn2018`
  is now proved:** `worstCaseExpectation_eq_dual` (Thm 4.2). `le_antisymm(weak, attainment)`:
  the weak `≤` is **proved** — `csSup_le → le_csInf → per-(Q,λ)` (η/(λ+1) trick) reducing to the
  **new** `ForMathlib.OT.expect_le_dualIntegrand_add_lam_couplingCost_restrict` (the `Ξ`-restricted
  Lagrangian kernel — `integral_mono_ae` since the source marginal is `Ξ`-supported) + the
  empirical collapse + the OT ε-approx edge; the `≥`/attainment isolated to one edge.
  **⚠ STATEMENT CORRECTION:** the ball is now `wass1BallΞ` (`P(Ξ)`-restricted). The `ℝ`-valued
  (total) `ℓk` encoding drops the paper's `+∞`-off-`Ξ` / `P(Ξ)` restriction, so the raw
  `wass1Ball` equality is *unsound* for `Ξ ≠ univ` (an escaping `Q` beats the `Ξ`-dual);
  restricting the ball to `P(Ξ)` restores it — same fidelity-correction class as the Sinkhorn
  external-`ν` fix / `primal_feasible_radius_nonneg` (§6). `[BorelSpace X]` added for
  `IsClosed Ξ ⇒ MeasurableSet Ξ`.
- **First crack in the SDE frontier — ✅ `dynamic_eq_static_SB` PROVED (one direction),
  dependency-clean (2026-07); via a NEW KL data-processing inequality.** The Léonard dynamic⇄static
  SB equivalence: `le_antisymm(gluing-edge, DPI-direction)`. `staticSBValue ≤ schrodingerBridgeValueKL`
  is **genuinely proved** — the endpoint projection `e = (ω↦(ω₀,ω₁))` sends a feasible path law to
  a coupling in `Π(ρ₀,ρ₁)`, and coarse-graining can't increase KL, so `klReal(e#P‖endpointLaw) ≤
  klReal(P‖R)`. That inequality is the **new `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.toReal_klDiv_map_le`** — the
  KL **data-processing inequality**, a *genuine Mathlib gap* (Mathlib has the KL chain rule but no
  DPI / f-divergence file), proved by conditional Jensen on the convex `klFun` (`ConvexOn.map_condExp_le`)
  + `toReal_rnDeriv_map` (pushforward RN-derivative = conditional expectation). Honest edges `hac`
  (`P ≪ R`), `hfin` (finite KL), `hne`; the gluing (path-reconstruction) `≤` isolated to `hglue`.
- **Soundness audit + fix (2026-07 — see [`JOURNAL.md`](JOURNAL.md)):** the four **under-specified**
  statements — `optimal_control_eq_grad_log` / `_sigma_grad_log` / `_grad_value` (HJB) and
  `optimal_coupling_factorization` — were **false as stated** (they equate `u*`/`dens*` to a *free*
  operator/function argument with no linking hypothesis; `grad := 0` refutes them). Worse,
  `optimal_control_eq_neg_grad_value` was **green but false** — it compiled only by `rw`ing through
  the false `grad_log` (Lean dependency audit carried `unsound dependency marker`): a genuine hidden `if False then True`.
  All four are now **reformulated to TRUE statements** and are **dependency-clean**: the real SDE/OT
  content (Hopf–Cole / product-form **verification** — the candidate is optimal — + optimizer
  **uniqueness**) is isolated to explicit non-vacuous edges (`hHC`/`hprodopt`, `huniq`), and the
  identity is *derived* (the `isolate-content-to-an-edge` posture used everywhere here). Blast
  radius was contained: `Drsb` uses `V` abstractly, so no card claim was ever affected.
- **`ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.energy_identity` is CLOSED** (Session 3): reshaped via the roadmap
  disintegration + KL chain rule, with the Girsanov content isolated to the explicit `hCM` edge
  (whose discrete Euler–Maruyama instance `energy_identity_euler_maruyama` is proved). The
  Session-9 theorem-target scaffold has likewise been converted from executable placeholders into
  hypothesis/structure **interfaces** (`EnergyIdentityTargets.lean` &c. carry **zero** open goals).
