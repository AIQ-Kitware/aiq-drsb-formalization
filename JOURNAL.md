# Session journal — ChenGeorgiouPavon2021 soundness audit + fix (2026-07)

Running log of the proof-pass session that audited the last `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021` sorries
for the "hidden `if False then True`" failure mode (a green-but-unsound theorem) and fixed it.
Companion to `AGENTS.md §9`, `PROOF_PIPELINE.md §2`, `formalization.yaml`.

## Starting state (inherited from the fork)
- 5 sorries, all in `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021/Basic.lean`: `energy_identity` (168),
  `optimal_control_eq_grad_log` (292), `optimal_control_eq_sigma_grad_log` (305),
  `optimal_control_eq_grad_value` (356), `optimal_coupling_factorization` (496).
- The fork proved a direction of `dynamic_eq_static_SB` via a new, genuinely-sound
  `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.toReal_klDiv_map_le` (KL data-processing inequality; verified
  its proof — real conditional-Jensen on the convex KL generator, no hidden falsity).

## Audit finding (the landmine)
Four of the five sorries are **false as stated**, not merely hard:
- `optimal_control_eq_grad_log/_sigma_grad_log/_grad_value` conclude `u* = grad(log φ)` /
  `σ²·grad(log φ)` / `grad(lam)` where **`grad`/`lam` are free operator arguments with no
  hypothesis constraining them to be the actual gradient**. Instantiate `grad := fun _ _ => 0`:
  the hypotheses (`SchrodingerSystem`, `HamiltonJacobi`, `IsOptimalSOC`) remain satisfiable but
  the conclusion `u* = 0` is false. So these can NEVER be discharged soundly as written.
- `optimal_coupling_factorization` concludes `dens_star(x,y) = φhat0 x · p x y · φ1 y` with
  **all of `dens_star,p,φhat0,φ1` free** — false (`dens_star:=0, p:=1,…`), and the conclusion
  is even mis-typed (a pointwise-everywhere density identity where only a.e. can hold).
- **`optimal_control_eq_neg_grad_value` is GREEN but FALSE** — it compiles only because its
  proof `rw`s through the false `optimal_control_eq_grad_log`. This is exactly the hidden
  `if False then True`: it *looks* proved.
- `energy_identity` is the one HONEST sorry — a true Girsanov identity, blocked only by the
  absence of Mathlib path-measure theory. Leave it, clearly labelled.

Blast radius: contained. `Drsb` (the card capstones) references `neg_grad_value` only in a
docstring; it takes `V` abstract, so no card claim depends on the false theorems. Verified by
grep: `grad_log` feeds only `neg_grad_value`; nothing else consumes any of the four.

## Fix strategy (the repo's own "isolate content to an explicit edge" pattern)
Turn each false statement into a TRUE one by isolating the genuine SDE/verification content to
explicit, non-vacuous hypotheses and DERIVING the stated identity — the same posture as every
strong-duality `le_antisymm(weak, attainment-edge)` here.
- Control theorems: add `hHC` (the Hopf–Cole / value-gradient candidate is itself optimal — the
  CGP verification theorem, the real SDE content) + `huniq` (the SOC optimizer is unique — strict
  convexity of the control energy). Then `u* = candidate` is `huniq u* candidate hopt hHC`.
  With `grad:=0`, `hHC` now forces the zero control optimal ⇒ `u*=0` ⇒ conclusion true: no
  counterexample survives. Thread the two edges through `neg_grad_value`.
- Factorization: reformulate to the measure-level Schrödinger factorization — `π_star` equals the
  product-form coupling `π_prod` (density `φ̂(x)·φ(y)` w.r.t. the reference endpoint law), via the
  verification edge (`π_prod` feasible+optimal) + uniqueness of the KL projection. Conclusion is a
  measure/`withDensity` identity (well-typed), not a pointwise density.

## Progress — DONE (2026-07)
- ✅ `optimal_control_eq_grad_log` / `_sigma_grad_log` / `_grad_value`: reformulated with the
  `hHC` (Hopf–Cole / value-gradient candidate optimal) + `huniq` (optimizer unique) edges;
  identity derived by `huniq u* candidate hopt hHC`. Now **axiom-clean** (no `sorryAx`).
- ✅ `optimal_control_eq_neg_grad_value` (was **green but false**): threaded the two edges through
  its call to `grad_log`. Now genuinely **axiom-clean** — the landmine is defused.
- ✅ `optimal_coupling_factorization`: reformulated to the well-typed **measure** identity
  `π* = R₀₁.withDensity(φ̂(x)·φ(y))` via verification (`hprodfeas`/`hprodopt`) + uniqueness
  (`huniq`); derived `π*=π_prod` then rewrote. Now **axiom-clean**.
- ⏳ `energy_identity` (168): intentionally the SOLE remaining sorry — a *true* Girsanov identity
  (`#print axioms` shows the expected `sorryAx`), blocked only by the absence of Mathlib
  continuous path-measure / Girsanov theory. Its discrete Euler–Maruyama layer is already proved
  (`energy_identity_euler_maruyama`, via the vendored Cameron–Martin identity). Closing it means
  building path-measure theory (a multi-month upstream program), not a session.

## Verification
- `#print axioms` on all five reformulated declarations: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
  (NO `sorryAx`). `energy_identity`: `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (as it
  should be — the one honest sorry). Full `lake build` green (8597 jobs). Sorry count 5 → 1.
- Each reformulation is a TRUE implication with **non-vacuous** premises (all jointly satisfiable
  in the real CGP problem: pick the actual `φ`/potentials, the actual unique optimizer, and the
  true verification facts). No free-operator counterexample survives, and no premise is
  contradictory. The genuine SDE/convexity content is isolated to explicit edges — the same
  posture every strong-duality equality in this repo uses (`le_antisymm(weak, attainment-edge)`).

## Takeaway for the next agent
The "hidden `if False then True`" risk the user flagged was REAL and present (a green theorem
whose stated content was false). The tell: a conclusion that equates a real object to an
**arbitrary free operator/function argument** with no hypothesis linking them. When removing the
last sorries, always ask "is the conclusion actually pinned down by the hypotheses, or could I
instantiate a free variable to break it?" — and confirm with `#print axioms` that a green
downstream theorem doesn't secretly carry `sorryAx` from a false lemma.

# Session 2 — "right shape / no erroneous or extra assumptions" audit (2026-07)

Follow-up pass with the explicit goal: *find the right shape for the theorems and ensure there
are no erroneous or extra assumptions.* Ran the `unusedVariables` / `unusedSectionVars` linters
across every library and inspected each flagged hypothesis. Two distinct outcomes, one principle:
**no unused hypothesis is left un-signalled.**

## Finding: two kinds of unused hypothesis
1. **Restatement leftovers (REMOVE).** The four CGP optimal-control theorems still carried
   `hsys : SchrodingerSystem …` (plus `lap`/`φhat`/`dens0`/`dens1`) and `optimal_control_eq_grad_value`
   carried `hHJ : HamiltonJacobi …`. These were **never used** and — worse — *misleading*: they
   suggested the PDE structure did logical work when the real content was already assumed in the
   `hHC` verification edge. Because the paper's `hsys ⇒ conclusion` link is unformalizable (no
   Mathlib path measures), the theorem is *restated* with the consequence `hHC` as hypothesis, so
   `hsys`/`hHJ` are pure leftovers → **removed**. `SchrodingerSystem`/`HamiltonJacobi` kept as
   *documentary* defs (docstrings updated to say so). Also `omit [NormedSpace ℝ X]` where unused.
2. **Faithful paper premises subsumed by explicit edges (KEEP, `_`-mark).** Gao–Kleywegt
   (`weak_duality_prop1` `hΨ`/`hδ`; `worstCase_structure_cor1` `hκ`/`husc`/`hproper`/`hlam`/`hexists`;
   `dualValue_eq_empiricalDual` `hN`; `cor2ii` `hlam`/`hexists`) and Mohajerin-Esfahani–Kuhn
   (`worstCaseExpectation_eq_dual` (Thm 4.2), `worstCase_program`, `worstCase_exists`: Assumption 4.1
   `hΞconv`/`hconv`/`hlsc`/`hdata`, plus `hε`/`hℓ`/`hExist`) carry the *source theorem's own*
   hypotheses, unused only because we supply stronger explicit formalization edges (`hOT`/`hattain`/
   `hdom`/`hbdd`/`hφint`) that subsume them. Removing them would **reduce fidelity** to the paper.
   Instead `_`-prefixed (matching the pre-existing `_hκ` in `strong_duality_thm1`) so "kept for
   faithfulness, not proof-critical" is explicit at the binder, and `omit` the unused
   `[NormedAddCommGroup X]` instance where flagged.

Key discrimination test used before `_`-marking any hypothesis: **is the conclusion non-vacuous
and does the proof actually establish it constructively (not by assuming it)?** Every `_`-marked
theorem here has a genuine constructive/duality conclusion (`le_antisymm(constructive, one attainment
edge)` or an explicit worst-case measure), so the unused paper premise is honest fidelity, not a
vacuity enabler. Whenever `hℓ` (the "loss = max of `K` pieces" structure) is unused, that is
*correct*: the Wasserstein-DRO duality equality holds for generic `ℓ`; the max structure only
feeds the paper's downstream LP reduction.

## Verification
- Full `lake build` green (8597 jobs). Sorry count unchanged at **1** (`energy_identity`, honest).
- `#print axioms` on all touched theorems (CGP ×5, Gao ×4, MEK ×3): `[propext, Classical.choice,
  Quot.sound]`, **no `sorryAx`**. Renaming/removing *unused* hypotheses cannot change a proof term,
  and the axiom check confirms it.
- Safety net: `_`-prefixing an actually-used hypothesis errors immediately (its uses become unknown
  identifiers); the clean build proves every `_`-marked hypothesis was genuinely unused.

## Takeaway for the next agent
"Extra assumption" splits in two. If a flagged-unused hypothesis is a *restatement leftover* that
duplicates content assumed elsewhere (or misleads about what does the work) → **remove it**. If it
is the *source theorem's own premise*, retained for fidelity and subsumed by an explicit edge →
**keep it, `_`-prefixed** (fidelity beats a shorter signature; the `_` makes intent machine-checkable).
Never `_`-mark to hide a hypothesis that *should* be load-bearing — first confirm the conclusion is
non-vacuous and constructively proved.

# Session 3 — closing the last sorry: `energy_identity` (2026-07)

Goal: stop treating the last `sorry` (`energy_identity`, CGP 4.19) as a monolithic "multi-month
Girsanov" and actually break it down. Result: **the repo is now `sorry`-free and axiom-clean.**

## The decomposition (ROADMAP_ENERGY_IDENTITY.md)
Disintegrate both path laws over the initial coordinate — `e_#P = ρ₀ ⊗ₘ Kᵘ`, `e_#R = ρ₀^W ⊗ₘ Kᵂ`
for a start-plus-centered-path measurable iso `e : Path X ≃ᵐ X × Path X`. Then
`D(P‖R)` = (i) `D(e_#P‖e_#R)` [KL invariant under `e`] = (ii) `D(ρ₀‖ρ₀^W) + D(cond)` [KL chain rule]
= (iii) `D(ρ₀‖ρ₀^W) + energy` [conditional term = control energy]. The unlock: Mathlib's
`klDiv_compProd_eq_add` *"holds without any assumption on the measurable spaces"*, so the abstract
`Path X = ℝ→X` is no obstruction.

## Phase 0 (committed) — `ForMathlib.MeasureTheory.toReal_klDiv_compProd_eq_add`
Real-valued KL chain rule (`toReal` of `klDiv_compProd_eq_add` + `ENNReal.toReal_add`). Thin,
reusable, axiom-clean.

## Phase 1 (committed) — `energy_identity` reshaped, last sorry closed
Proof = `klDiv_map_measurableEquiv` (KL invariance under `e`, from the vendored gibbs file) `rw`
+ the compProd factorizations `hPfact`/`hRfact` `rw` + Phase-0 chain rule (finiteness edges
`hfin_marg`/`hfin_cond`) + the Cameron–Martin edge `hCM`. All content isolated to honest
structural / finite-energy / `hCM` edges — house pattern. `schrodingerBridge_KL_eq_SOC` rewired to
take the identity bundled per feasible control (`hEI`), decoupling it from the disintegration
plumbing. `#print axioms energy_identity` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. Build green,
**0 sorries repo-wide.**

## Phase 2 — the continuum `hCM` discharge: BLOCKED (honestly)
`hCM` (`∫ D(Kᵘ_x‖Kᵂ_x)dρ₀ = 𝔼[∫½‖u‖²]`) is the sole Girsanov content. Its **discrete
Euler–Maruyama instance is already the proved theorem** `energy_identity_euler_maruyama`. The
**continuum** discharge is genuinely blocked: grep-confirmed, Mathlib has **no stochastic integral,
no Girsanov, no stochastic exponential, no KL lower-semicontinuity**. The continuum identity's RN
derivative between path measures *is* a stochastic exponential, so route 2b needs the Itô integral;
route 2a (discrete→continuum limit) needs SDE weak-convergence + KL lsc — both absent. This is a
mathematical fact about the proof, not a lack of effort. The honest state: `hCM` stays an explicit,
non-vacuous edge whose discrete instance is a theorem; closing the continuum requires porting an
Itô/Girsanov stack into Mathlib (`raphaelrrcoelho/formal-mathfin`, 1-D → multi-D + KL) — a real
project, scoped in ROADMAP Phase 2. Intermediate win available: (cond), Mathlib's *own* stated
TODO (`μ[fun x ↦ klDiv (κ x)(η x)]`), would tighten `hCM` to the per-trajectory atom — a PR-sized
gap-fill, does not by itself close the continuum.

## Takeaway for the next agent
"Break it down" beat "defer as multi-month": the last sorry fell to a Mathlib-backed chain-rule
split with the true research content quarantined to a single per-trajectory edge. What remains is
**not** a DRSB problem — it is the absence of the Itô integral from Mathlib. Do not fake it with a
`sorry` or a vacuous edge; either port the Itô/Girsanov stack (the real Phase 2) or leave `hCM` as
the honest, discrete-instance-proved edge.

## Session 4 (2026-07) — Phase 1.5 (cond) proved: Mathlib's conditional-KL TODO closed
Pushed toward Phase 2 by landing the roadmap's intermediate step (cond). Two new axiom-clean
theorems in `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/KLChainRule.lean`:
- `klDiv_compProd_eq_lintegral` : `klDiv (μ⊗ₘκ)(μ⊗ₘη) = ∫⁻ x, klDiv (κ x)(η x) ∂μ` (ℝ≥0∞);
- `toReal_klDiv_compProd_eq_integral` : the real Bochner-integral form (adds a finiteness edge).

This is **exactly the `TODO` Mathlib's own `InformationTheory/KullbackLeibler/ChainRule.lean`
records** (the `μ[fun x ↦ klDiv (κ x)(η x)]` form, deferred there because `x ↦ klDiv (κ x)(η x)`
"is not always guaranteed" measurable). The trick to dodge that: never integrate the slice map as a
black box — show `μ⊗ₘκ = (μ⊗ₘη).withDensity (fun p ↦ Kernel.rnDeriv κ η p.1 p.2)`, so the compProd
RN-derivative *is* the jointly measurable kernel derivative, then `lintegral_compProd` peels the
outer integral and each inner slice is recognised as `klDiv (κ x)(η x)`. Only hypothesis: absolute
continuity `μ⊗ₘκ ≪ μ⊗ₘη`, plus the standard `CountableOrCountablyGenerated 𝓧 𝓨` typeclass (the
setting where `Kernel.rnDeriv` is jointly measurable). `#print axioms` clean on both.

**Honest caveat — why this does NOT (yet) tighten the placeholder `energy_identity`.** The (cond)
lemma needs `CountableOrCountablyGenerated X (Path X)`. For the placeholder `Path X = ℝ→X` (an
uncountable-index `Pi` σ-algebra, not countably generated) with a non-countable state `X`, that
typeclass is **unsatisfiable** — so wiring (cond) into the current `energy_identity` would demand a
false instance, i.e. a vacuous edge, which is exactly the "if False then True" landmine this whole
audit exists to prevent. **Refused.** `energy_identity`'s signature is left unchanged. To actually
tighten its `hCM` edge to the per-trajectory atom one must first upgrade `Path` to a standard-Borel
continuous-path model (`C([0,1],X)`/Polish) — a modeling step, not new mathematics. Until then
(cond) stands as a proved, reusable reduction (a genuine Mathlib contribution) and the roadmap's
Phase-1.5 box is ticked. Phase 2 (continuum `hCM`) remains blocked on the Itô integral, unchanged.

### Session 4 addendum — (cond) WIRED abstractly: `energy_identity_conditional`
Landed `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.energy_identity_conditional` (axiom-clean): the `energy_identity`
disintegration with the (cond) reduction applied *inside*, so its Girsanov edge is already the
per-trajectory atom `hCM : (∫⁻ x, klDiv (Ku x)(Kw x) ∂ρ₀).toReal = energyVal`. The trick to keep it
honest (non-vacuous): state it over an **abstract** path-space factor `𝓨` with
`CountableOrCountablyGenerated 𝒳 𝓨` as a *hypothesis on a free type variable* — satisfiable for any
standard-Borel `𝓨` — instead of trying to force that (unsatisfiable) instance onto the concrete
`Path X = ℝ→X`. So Phase 2 now has a crisp target: instantiate `𝓨` = standard-Borel continuous
paths, build the SDE kernels, and discharge `hCM`'s continuum (Girsanov, still Itô-blocked); the
discrete instance `energy_identity_euler_maruyama` already proves the grid version of that atom.

### Session 4 addendum 2 — Phase 2 `≥` half made Itô-free (DPI → projection limit)
"Complete Phase 2" pushed against the honest wall: re-verified against the *current* pinned Mathlib
(`476fb97b62`, 2026-06-11) that there is **no** stochastic integral / Girsanov / stochastic
exponential / Cameron–Martin / quadratic variation — only basic martingales + predictable processes.
The feedback-drift continuum Girsanov density genuinely needs the Itô integral; it cannot be faked.

But the continuum identity is TWO inequalities, and they are not equally hard — so I split the edge:
- `le_toReal_klDiv_of_map_tendsto` (ForMathlib, axiom-clean): if measurable projections `gᵢ` push
  `μ,ν` to images whose KL → L, then `L ≤ KL(μ‖ν)`. Pure corollary of the existing DPI
  `toReal_klDiv_map_le` + `le_of_tendsto`.
- `energy_le_klReal_of_projections` (CGP, axiom-clean): instantiates it with time-grid projections to
  give the **`≥` half of (4.19)** — `𝔼[∫½‖u‖²] ≤ D(P^{u}‖R)` — modulo only an Itô-FREE convergence
  edge `hconv` (grid KLs → energy, discharged by the proved discrete Cameron–Martin
  `energy_identity_euler_maruyama` + Riemann sums). No stochastic integral.

Net: the monolithic Girsanov edge `hCM` is now split — the lower bound is a theorem (mod an Itô-free
edge), and ONLY the upper bound `D(P^{u}‖R) ≤ 𝔼[∫½‖u‖²]` (projections must *exhaust* the σ-algebra —
the genuine stochastic-exponential content) remains Itô-blocked. That is the honest, precise Phase-2
core: it needs the Itô/stochastic-analysis stack built in (or ported into) Mathlib. Not faked.

### Session 4 addendum 3 — Phase 2 ≤-half STRUCTURAL CORE proved (Itô-free martingale convergence)
Broke the ≤ half into small steps and landed them one by one (all axiom-clean):
- step 1 `toReal_klDiv_map_eq_integral_condExp`, 2a `klDiv_map_eq_lintegral_ofReal_klFun_condExp`:
  the (real / ℝ≥0∞) representation `KL(g#μ‖g#ν) = ∫ klFun(ν[dμ/dν|comap g])` — pushforward KL as the
  klFun-integral of the conditional expectation of the density (the martingale value).
- step 2b `klDiv_map_le`: the ℝ≥0∞ data-processing inequality (no finiteness), giving `limsup ≤ KL`.
- step 2c `klDiv_map_tendsto_toReal`: THE theorem. `(klDiv (μ.map gₙ)(ν.map gₙ)).toReal →
  (klDiv μ ν).toReal` when `comap gₙ` generates `m𝓧`. Lévy's upward theorem
  (`Integrable.tendsto_ae_condExp`, present in Mathlib) gives `ν[dμ/dν|ℱn] → dμ/dν` a.e.; Fatou
  (`lintegral_liminf_le`) gives `KL ≤ liminf`, `klDiv_map_le` gives `limsup ≤ KL`; the ℝ≥0∞
  liminf/limsup sandwich + toReal continuity finish. NO stochastic integral — this is the "projections
  exhaust the σ-algebra" fact the DPI cannot give.
- step 3 `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.energy_eq_klReal_of_projections`: the FULL `=` identity
  `𝔼[∫½‖u‖²] = D(P^{u}‖R)`. Both directions from step 2c (projected KLs → the full KL) + the edge
  `hconv` (projected KLs → energy) via `tendsto_nhds_unique`.

Net: the continuum energy identity now has BOTH inequalities proved Itô-free, and the ENTIRE
remaining Itô content is localised to the single edge `hconv` = "the exact-SDE finite-dimensional
(grid) relative entropies converge to the control energy." For the Euler–Maruyama/Gaussian marginals
(the card's object) that edge is Itô-free (discrete Cameron–Martin + Riemann sums,
`energy_identity_euler_maruyama`); for the exact feedback diffusion it is the finite-dimensional
Girsanov density — the genuine stochastic-exponential content, still the honest Phase-2 wall. Nothing
faked; `hconv` and the σ-algebra-generation hypothesis are honest, satisfiable (standard-Borel model)
edges, not vacuous ones.

### Session 4 addendum 4 — the "+Riemann sums" brick of `hconv` is now PROVED; wall sharpened to two named gaps
Landed the Δt→0 analytic core (axiom-clean, in `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/GaussianEntropy.lean`):
- `tendsto_equispaced_riemannSum` — equispaced left-endpoint Riemann sums of a continuous
  `g : ℝ → ℝ` on `[0,1]` converge to `∫₀¹ g`. Elementary uniform-continuity proof: error
  `= Σₖ ∫_{k/n}^{(k+1)/n} (g(k/n) − g t) dt`, each term `≤ (ε/2)·(1/n)` once `1/n < δ(ε)`
  (`sum_integral_adjacent_intervals`, `norm_integral_le_of_norm_le_const`,
  `IsCompact.uniformContinuousOn_of_continuous`).
- `tendsto_emEnergy_sampled` — for a continuous control profile `v` sampled on the uniform grid,
  `emEnergy (1/n) (v(·/n)) → ∫₀¹ ½ Σᵢ (vₜ i)² dt`. The discrete energy the DRSB card measures is a
  consistent quadrature of CGP (4.20). Pure analysis, no stochastic content.

This discharges the "+ Riemann sums" half of the EM-model `hconv`. Combined with the already-proved
`energy_identity_euler_maruyama` (grid KL = discrete energy), the EM-model `hconv` now factors into
two Itô-free pieces plus ONE remaining gap: *grid KL of the continuum path measure = discrete energy*
— i.e. the existence + finite-dim projection of the continuum reference measure itself.

Sharpened the wall (verified against the current pin). The continuum reference is **not** the Itô
integral — it is **Kolmogorov extension for dependent projective families**, which the pin does not
have: `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Constructions.Projective` provides only the `IsProjectiveLimit`
*predicate* + uniqueness; existence exists only for **product** measures (`infinitePi`) and
Ionescu–Tulcea Markov trajectories. The Brownian projective family IS built and proved consistent
(`Mathlib.Probability.BrownianMotion.GaussianProjectiveFamily.isProjectiveMeasureFamily_projectiveFamily`,
with `IsPreBrownianReal`/`IsBrownianReal` predicates in `…BrownianMotion.Basic`) — but the file's own
docstring notes the extension theorem is "not in Mathlib yet". So the continuum wall is now **two
sharply-named, disjoint Mathlib gaps**: (1) Kolmogorov extension for dependent families (→ the
continuum reference measure), and (2) the Itô/Girsanov stack (→ the feedback-drift density). Both are
multi-file Mathlib-scale ports; neither is faked, and the analytic + discrete Cameron–Martin layers
around them are now fully proved and axiom-clean.

### Session 4 addendum 5 — ≤-half core generalized: `hfin`-free ℝ≥0∞ convergence extracted
Factored `klDiv_map_tendsto_toReal` into its genuinely more general `ℝ≥0∞` core:
- `ForMathlib…klDiv_map_tendsto` (NEW, axiom-clean, **no finiteness hypothesis**):
  `klDiv (μ.map gₙ) (ν.map gₙ) → klDiv μ ν` in `ℝ≥0∞` whenever `μ ≪ ν` and `comap gₙ` generates
  `m𝓧`. The liminf/limsup sandwich (Lévy + Fatou + ℝ≥0∞ DPI) already lived in `[0,∞]`, so `hfin`
  was never needed for it — it holds even when `klDiv μ ν = ⊤` (projected divergences ↑ ⊤).
- `klDiv_map_tendsto_toReal` is now the one-line `toReal` corollary (adds `hfin` only to push
  through `ENNReal.continuousAt_toReal`). Downstream `energy_eq_klReal_of_projections` unchanged.

This is the right generality for the singular/infinite-energy continuum case (where `μ ⊥ ν` and
both KL and the energy are `⊤`). Full build green (8598).

Also scoped (and honestly declined) the concrete edge-free instance on `infinitePiNat` Gaussians:
`klDiv_map_tendsto` needs `μ ≪ ν`, which for infinite Gaussian products is Kakutani's dichotomy
(`≪` iff `∑ cₙ² < ∞`, else `⊥`) — and the pin has **no** infinite-product absolute-continuity /
Kakutani lemma (grep-confirmed; only Riesz–Markov–Kakutani, unrelated). So even a concrete
finitely-supported instance needs an infinite-product-ac lemma that isn't there. A THIRD named,
disjoint pin gap (after Kolmogorov extension and Itô/Girsanov) — not faked, recorded here.

### Session 4 addendum 6 — the `hgen`-provider generation lemma (product/discrete-time models)
After confirming (a) `optimal_control_eq_neg_grad_value` is already proved (PROOF_PIPELINE stale
there) so the card side is complete, and (b) gap #1 (Kolmogorov extension) is NOT yet on Mathlib
master (`ProjectiveFamilyContent.lean` still says the extension is "not yet in Mathlib"; only the
premeasure content + `ClosedCompactCylinders` tightness API are staged) → a pin bump won't close it
today; wait-for-upstream is the efficient call.

Landed the reusable structural companion to `klDiv_map_tendsto` (axiom-clean):
- `ForMathlib…iSup_comap_frestrictLe_eq_pi` — for a preorder-indexed product `∀ i, α i`, the
  finite-prefix restrictions generate the product σ-algebra:
  `⨆ i, comap (Preorder.frestrictLe i) = MeasurableSpace.pi`. This is the **`hgen`-provider** that
  makes the martingale-convergence identity `klDiv_map_tendsto` apply to ANY product / discrete-time
  model (take `gᵢ = frestrictLe i`). Mathlib has the pieces (`measurable_frestrictLe`,
  `generateFrom_measurableCylinders`) but not this `⨆ = pi` statement — a small standalone gap-fill,
  upstreamable. Proof: `≤` from measurability of `frestrictLe`; `≥` because each coordinate `eval j`
  factors as `(eval ⟨j,·⟩) ∘ frestrictLe j`, and `pi = ⨆ j comap (eval j)` by definition.

Note it does NOT discharge the *continuum* `hgen` for `Path X = ℝ→X` (uncountable index → countable
grid projections do NOT generate the full product σ-algebra; that needs a continuous-path /
standard-Borel model where rational times determine the path). It is the discrete-time / product
tool, and the right foundation for a future continuous-path model's rational-grid generation.

### Session 4 addendum 7 — plan (A): continuum `hgen` discharged via a KL-preserving embedding
Vendored the Kolmogorov extension (see ForMathlib/KolmogorovExtension/) and built the continuum
reference `wienerMeasure`; then attacked the `≤`-half's `hgen` (which is *false* for the raw
`Path X=ℝ→X`: countable finite-time projections can't generate the uncountable-index product
σ-algebra). Recon: neither Mathlib nor RemyDegenne/brownian-motion exposes a standard-Borel
`C(T,ℝ)` path-space TYPE (brownian-motion works via continuous *modifications* in the `T→Ω→E`
process picture). So the honest route is NOT to make `Path X` grid-generated, but to reparametrise:

- `ForMathlib…toReal_klDiv_map_eq_of_leftInverse` (NEW, axiom-clean): a measurable map with a
  measurable left inverse (split mono / measurable embedding) PRESERVES KL — DPI both ways. Engine.
- `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021.energy_eq_klReal_via_embedding` (NEW, axiom-clean): the FULL `=` energy
  identity whose only continuum edge is a **measurable embedding `e : Path X ↪ (ℕ→ℝ)` with
  measurable left inverse** (a lossless reparametrisation by countably many reals) + `hconv`.
  Composes: `toReal_klDiv_map_eq_of_leftInverse` (e preserves KL) → on `ℕ→ℝ`,
  `iSup_comap_frestrictLe_eq_pi` (prefix restrictions generate) feeds `klDiv_map_tendsto` (Lévy) so
  grid divergences → `KL(e#P‖e#R)=KL(P‖R)` → `tendsto_nhds_unique` vs `hconv`.

The embedding edge is **satisfiable** (a standard-Borel continuous-path law admits `e` = restriction
to countably many dense times, injective by `Continuous.ext_on` → a measurable embedding by
Lusin–Souslin `Measurable.measurableEmbedding`, with `MeasurableEmbedding.invFun` the left inverse),
whereas the old `hgen` on `ℝ→X` was unsatisfiable. Itô-free. Remaining for a *fully closed* continuum
identity: (i) realise `e` concretely for the DRSB continuous-path model (needs the standard-Borel
continuous-path structure — a further vendor from brownian-motion's Continuity/Choquet), and (ii)
`hconv` for the controlled law (still the Girsanov/gap-#2 content for feedback drift).

### Session 4 addendum 8 — plan A(i) DONE: the embedding edge is now a THEOREM (no vendor needed)
Item (i) above turned out **not** to need a brownian-motion vendor at all — Mathlib already has every
piece, they just had to be assembled. New module `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/PathEmbedding.lean`
(all axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, full build green 8667 jobs):
- `exists_measurableEmbedding_nat_of_separating` — **the engine.** For a nonempty standard-Borel `E`
  with a countable *point-separating measurable* family `φ : ℕ→E→ℝ`, the coordinate map `x↦(n↦φ n x)`
  is a measurable embedding into `ℕ→ℝ` (`Measurable.measurableEmbedding`, Lusin–Souslin — needs only
  `StandardBorelSpace E` + `CountablySeparated (ℕ→ℝ)`, both inferred) with a measurable left inverse
  (`MeasurableEmbedding.{invFun, measurable_invFun, leftInverse_invFun}`, needs `[Nonempty E]`). Pure
  measurable-space content, no topology.
- `exists_measurableEmbedding_nat_continuousMap` — **the concrete continuous-path instance.** For `T`
  compact / locally-compact / second-countable / nonempty, `C(T,ℝ)` (sup-norm) is separable
  (`ContinuousMap.instSeparableSpace`) + complete (`…instCompleteSpaceOfCompactlyCoherentSpace`, via
  `CompactSpace→WeaklyLocallyCompact→CompactlyCoherentSpace`) metric ⇒ Polish ⇒ (with the assumed
  Borel σ-algebra) standard Borel; dense-time evaluation `f↦f(denseSeq T n)` is measurable
  (`continuous_eval_const`) and point-separating (`Continuous.ext_on` + `DFunLike.coe_injective`), so
  the engine applies. **This is the `e`/`g` the abstract edge asked for, now constructed.**
- `toReal_klDiv_map_frestrictLe_tendsto_of_separating` — **absorbs the embedding edge into a KL-limit
  theorem.** Composes the engine with `toReal_klDiv_map_eq_of_leftInverse` (embedding preserves KL) +
  `klDiv_map_tendsto_toReal` (Lévy, `hgen` from `iSup_comap_frestrictLe_eq_pi` on `ℕ→ℝ`): for `P≪R`
  finite-KL on such an `E`, the grid-projected divergences (first `n+1` coords of `x↦(n↦φ n x)`)
  converge to `KL(P‖R)`. `eq_toReal_klDiv_of_separating_tendsto` is the `=` corollary vs an energy
  edge `L`.
- `eq_toReal_klDiv_continuousMap_of_tendsto` — **the continuum energy identity for the continuous-path
  model with the embedding edge DISCHARGED.** Same statement shape as
  `energy_eq_klReal_via_embedding` but the measurable-embedding hypothesis is *gone* (proved
  internally from dense-time evaluation); only `hconv` (finite-dim marginal KLs → energy, the
  Girsanov/gap-#2 content) and regularity (`hac`/`hfin`) remain.

Key discovery correcting addendum 7's plan: **no standard-Borel `C(T,ℝ)` TYPE needs building/vendoring
— Mathlib's `ContinuousMap` topology instances (SecondCountableSpace.lean, Compact.lean,
CompactConvergence.lean) already make `C(T,ℝ)` Polish**; only a `MeasurableSpace`/`BorelSpace C(T,ℝ)`
is absent, and that is taken as a satisfiable *hypothesis* (`= borel _`; the same instance
`RemyDegenne/brownian-motion` adds locally — cited `DRSB-INDEP`) rather than an orphan instance. So
plan A(i) is complete. The ONLY continuum content still open is `hconv` for the controlled law
(gap #2, feedback-drift Girsanov density — genuinely Itô-blocked), plus the modeling step of
re-typing DRSB's `SBData.Path` from the placeholder `ℝ→X` to `C([0,1],X)` to feed these lemmas
into `Drsb` directly (roadmap step 3).

## Session 5 (2026-07-04) — toward FULL closure: gap #3 (Kakutani ≪-direction) DONE
Goal this session: the *fully closed* continuum energy identity (edge-free, axiom-clean). Established
the precise remaining obstruction and landed the first hard brick.

**Framing.** After Plan A(i) (addendum 8) + the prior projection/martingale machinery, the continuum
identity `D(P^u‖R) = D(ρ₀‖ρ₀^W) + 𝔼[∫½‖u‖²]` is reduced to `hconv` (grid KLs → energy) **plus the
regularity edges `P^u ≪ R` and finite KL**. For the **deterministic (open-loop) drift** case —
`P^u` = a Cameron–Martin shift of the Wiener reference `R` — EVERYTHING except `P^u ≪ R` is already
proved or elementary (grid KL = finite-dim Gaussian CM energy via `GaussianEntropy`, → `∫½‖u‖²` via
`tendsto_emEnergy_sampled`; the reference `R = wienerMeasure` already exists via the vendored
Kolmogorov extension). So the **sole** remaining hard piece for a fully-closed *deterministic*
continuum identity is `P^u ≪ R` = gap #3 (infinite-dim Cameron–Martin / Kakutani absolute continuity),
and — crucially — it is **Itô-FREE** (the shift is deterministic; no stochastic integral).

**Landed (axiom-clean): the Kakutani `≪`-direction.** `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/AbsoluteContinuityMartingale.lean`:
`absolutelyContinuous_of_densityProcess` — a candidate law `μ` locally ac on each `ℱn` with density
process `Z n`, where `Z` is a **uniformly-integrable** `ν`-martingale on a filtration generating `m`,
is globally `μ ≪ ν`. A genuine Mathlib gap (pin has `Martingale.ae_eq_condExp_limitProcess` but not
this measure-level consequence). Proof: L¹ martingale convergence `Z n =ᵐ ν[Zlim|ℱn]` +
`setIntegral_condExp` + π-system uniqueness (`ext_of_generateFrom_of_iUnion`, new helper
`isPiSystem_iUnion_filtration`) + `withDensity_absolutelyContinuous`. This discharges the `P^u ≪ R`
edge **once the CM density process is exhibited as a UI (L²-bounded) martingale** — the L² bound being
`𝔼_R[Zn²] = exp(partial CM energy) ≤ exp(‖u‖²_CM) < ∞`, elementary.

**Route to full deterministic closure (remaining, honestly scoped — NOT yet done):**
- **Brick 1.5** — L²→UI bridge: uniform `eLpNorm (Zn) 2 ν ≤ C` ⇒ `UniformIntegrable Zn 1 ν` (Chebyshev
  tail via `uniformIntegrable_of`). Self-contained, moderate. Feeds Brick 1 from the L² bound.
- **Brick 2** (the big one) — construct the CM density process on `wienerMeasure`: `Zn` = the finite-dim
  Gaussian shift RN-derivative as a function of the grid coordinates; prove it is an `R`-martingale
  w.r.t. the grid filtration (Gaussian marginalization/consistency) and L²-bounded by `exp(energy_n)`.
  **This needs finite-dimensional Gaussian RN-derivative infrastructure** (the density, not just the
  KL `klDiv_stdGaussian_map_add` that `GaussianEntropy.lean` currently has) — possibly a real sub-gap
  to fill. Highest-risk, likely multi-session.
- **Brick 3** — assemble: `P^u := R.withDensity Zlim` (so `≪` is Brick 1 / free), recover the shifted-
  Gaussian grid marginals via the tower property (`ae_eq_condExp_limitProcess`), grid KL = CM energy,
  Riemann → `∫½‖u‖²`, feed `eq_toReal_klDiv_continuousMap_of_tendsto` / the projection identity.

Honest status: the **feedback-drift** continuum identity remains Itô-blocked (gap #2, unchanged). The
**deterministic** continuum identity is now blocked only on Brick 2's Gaussian-density construction —
no longer on abstract impossibility. Nothing faked; `absolutelyContinuous_of_densityProcess` is a
real, reusable, axiom-clean contribution and the correct next tool.

## Session 6 (2026-07-07) — continuum-closure survey → plan → the hard abstract bricks landed
Three-phase session (Fable survey → Opus review → Fable implementation of the reviewed plan's
hardest tickets), coordinated by the user.

**Phase 1 — survey (Fable → Opus).** Graded every remaining brick of the Session-5 "route to
full deterministic closure" against the pinned Mathlib; report at
`dev/journals/2026-07-07-continuum-energy-closure-survey.md`. Verdict: deterministic case
reachable (blocked only on a finite-dim Gaussian density layer), feedback case genuinely
Itô-blocked (stochastic integral grep-confirmed absent). Plan written to
**`PLAN_CONTINUUM_CLOSURE.md`**: work in iid-Gaussian **sequence coordinates**
(`Measure.infinitePi`), where densities factorize into 1-D `gaussianReal` pieces and the
prefix filtration is the proved `iSup_comap_frestrictLe_eq_pi` setting; target **Theorem A**
= the infinite-dimensional Cameron–Martin/Kakutani KL identity
`klDiv ((infinitePi N(0,1)).map (·+c)) (infinitePi N(0,1)) = ofReal (½∑'c²)` for `ℓ²` shifts.

**Phase 2 — adversarial review (Opus).** Probed every load-bearing pin lemma. Three real
findings, all then fixed in the plan: **[C]** M4a overclaimed (Theorem A is the sequence
*model*, NOT CGP's path-kernel `hCM` edge — renamed `energy_identity_sequenceModel`, honest
docstring; the path identification is the stretch M4b); **[A]** M2.2's both routes
under-supported (no finite-pi Tonelli in the pin; `withDensity`-through-an-equiv missing);
**[B]** `frestrictLe` is `Finset.Iic`-based, so every `Set.Iic` in the plan was retyped
(and M2.4 got *easier*). Difficulty ranking recorded in the plan.

**Phase 3 — implementation (Fable): the review's two hardest bricks, axiom-clean.**
- `ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/PiWithDensity.lean` (NEW): `map_withDensity_measurableEquiv`
  (withDensity commutes with a measurable equiv — the review's missing sub-lemma);
  `pi_withDensity_fin`/`pi_withDensity` (product of withDensity factors = product measure
  with product density; dependent `Fin` induction via `piFinSuccAbove` + `prod_withDensity`,
  Fintype transport along `piCongrLeft` in the **cast-free `symm` orientation** —
  `Equiv.piCongrLeft_symm_apply` has no casts, the forward apply does);
  `lintegral_pi_prod_fin`/`lintegral_pi_prod` (finite-product Tonelli, instance-free of the
  density factors — defuses M2.7). Key tricks: state the whole successor step in
  `Fin.succAbove 0` form (`Fin.prod_univ_succAbove` — mixing in `.succ` breaks motives),
  and conclude injectivity via `MeasurableEquiv.map_measurableEquiv_injective`.
- `AbsoluteContinuityMartingale.lean` (EXTENDED): `uniformIntegrable_one_of_lintegral_sq_bdd`
  (L²-bound ⇒ UI; pointwise Chebyshev truncation `‖·‖ₑ ≤ ‖·‖ₑ²/C` needs NO measurability of
  the tail set); `martingale_of_setLIntegral_eq` (**the martingale property is free**: local
  densities consistent across levels force the tower property via
  `ae_eq_condExp_of_forall_setIntegral_eq`; NB this pin's `Martingale` wants
  `StronglyAdapted`, its `Adapted` is `Measurable`-based); and the composed
  `absolutelyContinuous_of_localDensity` (local densities + one L² moment bound ⇒ `μ ≪ ν`) —
  the exact interface M2.8 will call.

Gotcha for the record: this clone had NO oleans (`lake exe cache get` needed first);
`ℝ≥0` needs `open scoped NNReal` (the file only had `ENNReal` — the error surfaces as
bizarre `LE Type` failures at the `set` line).

**Remaining (Opus queue, per the plan's STATUS section):** M2.1→M2.3→M2.4→M2.5→M2.7→M2.8
(Gaussian specifics; all consumers of the above), M3 (Theorem A assembly), M4a (honest
sequence-model statement), M5 (docs). M4b (Wiener path transport) stretch; feedback/Itô
unchanged, forbidden to fake.

## Session 7 (2026-07-08) — sequence-model Cameron–Martin/Kakutani theorem closed

**Author:** GPT-5.5 Thinking, coordinated by Jon Crall. Local overlays were iteratively tested
by the user; the final state is reported `lake build` green.

The Session-6 plan's former M2→M4a queue is now implemented in
`ForMathlib/MeasureTheory/GaussianCameronMartin.lean` and wired honestly into
`ChenGeorgiouPavon2021/Basic.lean`:

- `stdSeqGaussian` finite-prefix and shifted-prefix marginals;
- `gaussianReal_shift_eq_withDensity` and `stdGaussian_map_add_eq_withDensity`;
- `cmDensityProcess`, `prefixFiltration`, and the prefix local-density theorem
  `map_add_eq_lintegral_cmDensityProcess`;
- the L² density-process bound `lintegral_sq_cmDensityProcess_le`;
- square-summability implies absolute continuity:
  `absolutelyContinuous_stdSeqGaussian_map_add_of_summable`;
- finite-energy KL identity:
  `klDiv_stdSeqGaussian_map_add_of_summable` and the `toReal` wrapper;
- converse/infinite branch:
  `summable_iff_klDiv_stdSeqGaussian_map_add_ne_top` and
  `klDiv_stdSeqGaussian_map_add_eq_top_iff_not_summable`;
- CGP-facing sequence wrappers:
  `energy_identity_sequenceModel`, `energy_identity_sequenceModel_finite_iff_summable`, and
  `energy_identity_sequenceModel_top_iff_not_summable`.

The proof route used the local-density martingale interface from Session 6, then avoided a
separate Gaussian-MGF proof for the L² moment by observing pointwise that the square of the
`c`-density is `exp(∑ c_i^2)` times the `2c` finite-dimensional density. The converse branch is
pure series/order theory plus the already-staged KL lower-bound wrappers: bounded partial energies
force square summability, hence nonsummability forces unbounded partial energies and KL `⊤`.

**Honest scope.** This closes the canonical iid Gaussian **sequence-coordinate**
Cameron–Martin/Kakutani theorem, including the finite/infinite dichotomy. It does **not** close the
full CGP path-kernel `hCM` edge: identifying this sequence theorem with Wiener/SDE path laws is the
remaining M4b path-transport bridge. Feedback drift remains the Itô/Girsanov wall; no provenance or
scope claim should imply otherwise.


## Session 8 (2026-07-08) — finite M4b/Wiener dyadic layer green; continuum capstones explicit

**Author:** GPT-5.5 Thinking, coordinated by Jon Crall. The user reported the final repair overlay
as a green build.

After the sequence-model Cameron--Martin/Kakutani milestone, we pushed into the M4b path-law bridge
and landed the finite-dimensional Wiener/dyadic layer in `ChenGeorgiouPavon2021/Basic.lean`:

- dyadic time grids and normalized dyadic increment maps;
- concrete standard-Wiener path-law interface over the existing `RealPath` scaffold;
- raw Brownian dyadic increment law;
- Gaussian scaling from variance `Δt` increments to standard normals;
- independence transport and finite product-law assembly for dyadic increments;
- finite shifted-grid with-density formulas;
- finite dyadic absolute continuity for Cameron--Martin shifts.

The important soundness correction was at the continuum edge. A proposed theorem asserting that
normalized dyadic increments generate the whole measurable structure of `RealPath := ℝ → ℝ` was
rejected as overstrong: dyadic increments on `[0,1]` do not determine negative-time coordinates,
outside-interval coordinates, or the absolute anchor of arbitrary real-time functions. The green
code keeps the justified finite-dimensional results and exposes the genuine continuum work as
interfaces:

```lean
HasDyadicKLExhaustion W
(W : Measure RealPath).map (fun ω : RealPath => ω + h) ≪ (W : Measure RealPath)
```

This is a net improvement over hidden `sorry`s: the finite Brownian/Gaussian calculations are now
proved, while the still-open analytic facts are visible at the call site. The next proof-bearing
step should not be another attempt to prove generation on `ℝ → ℝ`; it should first choose or build
a canonical anchored interval path carrier, then prove dyadic generation, KL exhaustion, path-space
Cameron--Martin quasi-invariance, and finally the Sobolev-energy bridge.
